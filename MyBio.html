			Harry Arthur Spencer IV, while sounding like the royalty he may actually be, was raised in a humble home in central Wisconsin.  While his love for all things cheese and Green Bay Packers remains strong, the urge to go to the correct university in the state of Kansas proved too strong, Kansas State University, as he would be the fifth generation of his family to attend. Dispite the conservative nature of this campus, Harry backlashed into the beautiful world of socialism and the hippy lifestyle.</p>

			<p>
			Keeping with his free loving theme, Harry spent a few years bumming around Asia, some of which he remembers.  Following this sojourn, he returned to Kansas to continue studying the humanities, as any self-rightous pretentious liberal would.  Follwoing this, as he got married and hit 30, he decided it was time to get a career that owuld actually make money, so he decided to start coding.  Ie: this web page.</p>
